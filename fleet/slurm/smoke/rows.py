Each row is one named claim with one verdict, and the table at the end is the
whole result.  Runs as an unprivileged user inside the container, after
``inside.sh`` has a controller and a node up; stdlib only, because it runs on
whatever Python the image happens to have.

The rows are ordered so that each one's evidence is available to the next:
row 5 leaves the killed job whose Epilog row 8 reads, and row 2 leaves the
